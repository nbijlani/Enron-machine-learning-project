# Enron-machine-learning-project
The goal of this project is to use the given financial and email information for selected Enron employees to generate a model that will help predict if an individual is a “person of interest” (POI for short) or not. A person of interest in the Enron fraud case refers to an individual who was found guilty of wrongdoing – reaping financial gain by accessing or hiding important financial or marketrelated information, hiding from or misinforming stakeholders on financial information, or colluding with such persons or not disclosing information related to such individuals to further their interest. The goal of this project is to analyze the given data set to see if there are any “markers” that can be isolated for persons of interest in order to distinguish them from other, non-POIs. Gaussian Naïve Bayes, SVM and Decision Tree classifiers were used.
